**This is just my attempt to dig into flux, React, webpack, es6 syntax and immutability**

It's an app written in few days while learning those technologies.

#### See a [working demo](http://vesparny.github.io/flux-immutable-example/).

then open http://localhost:3333

#### Build for production with Webpack

```shell
npm run build
```

#### Technology stack

* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), of course
* flux stuff handled by [flummox](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox) by [acdlite](https://github.com/acdlite/) (which is the best flux library I played with)
* Stores classification based on [gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon/flux-react-router-example) example.
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js)
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [react-immutable-render-mixin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-immutable-render-mixin)
